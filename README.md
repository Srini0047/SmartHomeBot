# Nexus: Smart Home Monitoring Bot

Nexus is an advanced smart home monitoring bot powered by ESP32. It combines environmental monitoring and obstacle avoidance features with a built-in vacuum cleaner to maintain a clean and safe living environment. This project leverages various sensors to detect environmental parameters and ensure efficient operation in dynamic surroundings. Sensor data is displayed on a webserver, and the bot can be controlled manually using Blynk IoT.

## Features

- **Environmental Monitoring**:
  - **DHT Sensor**: Measures temperature and humidity.
  - **Flame Sensor**: Detects fire hazards.
  - **Gas Sensor**: Monitors harmful gases in the surroundings.

- **Obstacle Detection**:
  - **IR Sensor**: Ensures smooth navigation by avoiding obstacles.

- **Cleaning Functionality**:
  - Equipped with a vacuum cleaner for maintaining cleanliness.

- **Control Options**:
  - **Manual Mode**: Controlled via Blynk IoT.
  - **Automatic Mode**: Navigates and operates autonomously.

- **Powered by ESP32**: The microcontroller acts as the brain of the bot, managing all sensor data and control functions.
